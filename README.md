Hi! My name is Trust Wells and I'm a student studying Computer Science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 

I'm currently a Software QA / Software Engineering Intern at Opendorse. My most experience consists of C#/.NET, but I also am midly skilled C++, React/JS/TS, and Python. I am currently pursuing any field in respect to SWE right now, but have found a new interest in low latency computing specializing in C++. Along with coding skills, I do keep up to date with common best practices and tips in the .NET space, such as Architecture Patterns, common NuGet packages, etc.

Reach out to me via my website at trustwells.com !!
