Hi! My name is Trust Wells and I'm a student studying Computer Science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 

I'm interested in becoming a software engineer, and am currently trying to find my first internship. I have learned to some extent in each: C, C#/.NET, Python, Java, Javascript, SQL, HTML, CSS, Data Structures & Algorithms, and more!

I have great interest in platform engineering, web dev, systems programming, devops, and much more!
