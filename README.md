Hi! My name is Trust Wells and I'm a student studying Computer Science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 

I'm currently a Software QA / Software Engineering Intern at Opendorse. My most experience consists with C#/.NET and React. I am currently pursuing any field in respect to SWE right now, but have found a new interest in low latency computing consisting of C++. Along with coding skills, I do keep up to date with common System Design standards in the .NET space such as Architecture patterns, Microservices, etc. 

Reach out to me via my website at trustwells.com !!
