Hi! My name is Trust Wells and I'm a student studying Computer Science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 

I'm interested in becoming a software engineer, and am currently trying to find my first internship. I have learned C, C#/.NET, Python, Java, Javascript, SQL, HTML, CSS, Data Structures & Algorithms, and more!

Have had experience through my education with systems programming and web development, but am open to any field!
