Hi! My name is Trust Wells and I'm a current junior Computer Science student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 

I'm interested in becoming a software engineer, and am currently trying to find my first internship. I have learned Python, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, Data Structures & Algorithms, and more!

I'm hoping to expand my knowledge on how to develop useful applications/devices using things I've learned about software engineering. 

Search my name up on LinkedIn, or even Facebook to reach out to me!
